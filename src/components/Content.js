            The Boy Who Cried Wolf describes a story of a boy who worked as a shepherd.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though working was easy, it was very boring. So he decided one day to take the advice of his master, recalling that if a wolf were to ever attack the sheep, villagers would come to the rescue if they heard the boy cry.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day he employs this, tricking the villagers into thinking that the sheep had been attacked. He thought this prank was so funny he decided to do it another time. A while later, wolves actually attacked the herd of sheep, and though the boy cried, the untrusting and tired villagers heard his cries did not come to the rescue- believing they were being tricked again. Many sheep died.
